library(Max.WCST.R)
What is Max.WCST.R?
Max.WCST.R provides tools to simulate and analyze the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) — a classic neuropsychological task that measures cognitive flexibility and abstract reasoning.

This task is especially relevant for detecting executive dysfunctions in conditions such as:

Schizophrenia

Frontal lobe damage

ADHD

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

Neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s, dementia)

In WCST, users must discover the sorting rule (color, shape, or number), adapt to rule changes, and avoid perseverative errors (repeating an old rule after it stops working). This package implements a full simulation framework for this logic.

Key Features
Generate realistic WCST decks with randomized rule shifts.

Run full interactive sessions using a Shiny interface.

Automatically track accuracy, rule inference, and error types.

Analyze trial-by-trial results and produce a performance summary.

Export a session PDF report with results and plots.

Generate a WCST Deck

![Deck Example](wcst_deck_example.png.png)
*Figure 2: Example of a WCST deck showing color, shape, number, and rule.*

deck <- generate_wcst_deck(10)
head(deck)
Each card matches the previous on exactly one feature. The matching rule changes every 4–8 correct trials to simulate real cognitive shifting demands.

Simulate a WCST Session

![Simulation Output](wcst_simulation_output.png.png)
*Figure 3: Output from a session showing trial-level results.*

session <- simulate_wcst_session(n_trials = 15)
head(session)
This simulates a full user session with feedback and correct/incorrect scoring. Rule changes are embedded dynamically, mimicking a real WCST.

Analyze the Results

![Performance Plot](wcst_analysis_plot.png.png)
*Figure 4: Trial-by-trial performance plot with rule switch markers.*

analyze_wcst_results(session)
You’ll receive statistics like total accuracy, number of correct switches, and perseverative errors.

Visualize the Results

plot_wcst_performance(session)
A performance plot showing trial accuracy and possible switching behavior over time.

Full Example Workflow

deck <- generate_wcst_deck(20)
session <- simulate_wcst_session(20)
analyze_wcst_results(session)
plot_wcst_performance(session)

Run the Shiny App
The interactive version of the WCST can be launched with:

run_wcst_app()
This opens a browser interface where users:

Select the rule they believe is correct (color/shape/number)

Get real-time feedback

Are tested on rule adaptation

Receive a PDF report at the end with their results

The app uses a hidden rule logic. Users must infer the rule through feedback, just like in the original WCST.

Extending Max.WCST.R
Possible extensions:

Simulate different user profiles (e.g., guessing, random, perseverative)

Add longitudinal testing support

Connect to experimental data collection platforms

Customize scoring or rule-switching thresholds
