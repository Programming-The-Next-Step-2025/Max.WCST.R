\title{Simulate a WCST session}
\usage{
simulate_wcst_session(
  n_trials = 30,
  rules = c("color", "shape", "number"),
  deck = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  strategy = c("perfect", "random", "probabilistic", "perseverative"),
  p_correct = 0.7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_trials}{Number of trials to simulate (default = 30). First trial is always shown as reference only.}

\item{rules}{A character vector indicating the sequence of sorting rules (default = c("color", "shape", "number")).}

\item{deck}{Optional pre-generated WCST deck. If NULL, a new deck is generated.}

\item{seed}{Optional seed for reproducibility.}

\item{strategy}{A character string defining the agent strategy. One of:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"perfect"}: always selects the correct rule.
  \item \code{"random"}: chooses randomly between color, shape, number.
  \item \code{"probabilistic"}: chooses correctly with probability \code{p_correct}.
  \item \code{"perseverative"}: sticks to the previous rule 60\% of the time.
}}

\item{p_correct}{Probability of selecting the correct rule when \code{strategy = "probabilistic"} (default = 0.7).}
}
\value{
A data frame with trial-by-trial results, including:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{trial}: the trial number.
    \item \code{rule}: the correct rule used to score the trial.
    \item \code{user_choice}: the rule selected by the simulated agent.
    \item \code{correct}: whether the response was correct.
  }
}
\description{
Simulates a Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) session with rule shifts and customizable agent strategies.
Can be used to simulate different cognitive profiles or behaviors.
