Description: Provides functions to simulate, score, and analyze the Wisconsin 
    Card Sorting Task (WCST), a widely used cognitive test that evaluates 
    executive functions such as cognitive flexibility and rule-shifting. 
    The package supports randomized deck generation with hidden rule changes, 
    session simulation, trial-by-trial scoring, summary statistics, and plotting. 
    Includes a Shiny interface for interactive testing and generates PDF reports 
    of user performance.
